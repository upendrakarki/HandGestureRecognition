# CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks  
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

Using CNN to detect hand gesture  
Using 4 different guesters to train our CNN and then try to perform simple task on computer using those Gestures  

Four Training Image is stored--  
One, Two, Three and Four folders  

HandGestureRecognition.m contains a Matlab code to train those images using CNN algorithm and classify them in performing task like "next image" "previous image" after opening a series of images on pc.
